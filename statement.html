								<h2>CW: SA/Harassment</h2>
								
								<p> On the CLS I and II papers, I am included as a coauthor alongside Geoff Marcy, a known serial sexual harasser and abuser. I was not a part of the decision to offer him authorship and I had no recourse to ask that he be removed. However, it was important to me that I remain on the papers as well, both because of my significant contributions to the RVSearch pipeline and because I refuse to make any more sacrifices for abusive men. I am committed to doing everything I can to make astronomy a safe and inclusive field, and that includes never collaborating with Geoff Marcy or other harassers.</p>
